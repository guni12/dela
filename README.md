Clone the dELa Frontend Code
------------------


```
git clone https://github.com/guni12/dela.git
```
or you can download the zip


### Fix the database

Look in the sql-folder. There you find the structure of the database tables. Use it and/or modify the content according to your needs.

You also find an example of how to set up the mysql database.php file. You can change to sqlite if you prefer.


### Install with composer

```
composer install
```

Now you should be ready to go!
